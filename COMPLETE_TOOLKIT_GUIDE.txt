  python format_all.py            (shows usage)


ADVANCED USAGE
==============

Batch Processing Multiple Folders:
cd C:\path\to\folder
python restructure_type_b.py *.xlsx

Creating Workflow Scripts:
Create a file called "format_portfolio.bat" with:
  @echo off
  cd C:\Users\aladi\Excel_Portfolio_Formating
  python restructure_type_b.py %1
  python format_all.py %1
  echo Done!

Then run: format_portfolio.bat "NewPortfolio.xlsx"


CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS
=====================

To modify colors or fonts:
1. Edit restructure_type_b.py or format_all.py
2. Find the "Define color scheme" or similar section
3. Change hex color codes (e.g., "1F4788" for dark blue)
4. Save and run the script again

Common customizations:
• Header color: Line with "header_fill = PatternFill(start_color="
• Section colors: Search for PatternFill in the code
• Font sizes: Look for Font(bold=True, size=XX)
• Column widths: Search for ".width = "


TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

Problem: "File not found"
Solution: Make sure Excel file is in same folder as the script

Problem: "Python not found"
Solution: Use full path: C:\Users\aladi\Excel_Portfolio_Formating\.venv\Scripts\python.exe script.py file.xlsx

Problem: Data looks incomplete in restructured file
Solution: The restructuring script finds data based on specific patterns
  - Make sure months are in format "Mar 25", "Apr 25", etc.
  - Make sure metric names are in column A

Problem: Formatting looks different than expected
Solution: Run format_all.py on the file to apply consistent formatting

Need to revert a file?
Solution: Backup your original files before restructuring
  - Keep original "Data" sheet files in a backup folder
  - Then use restructure_type_b.py on the backup


SUMMARY OF CHANGES MADE
=======================

Original Situation:
• Four separate portfolio files with inconsistent structures
• Type A: Traditional IRA (1 file with Executive Summary + Monthly Performance)
• Type B: Investment, Rollover IRA, Roth IRA (3 files with single Data sheet)
• Different layouts made comparison and reporting difficult

After Restructuring:
✓ All 4 portfolios unified into Type A structure
✓ All files have consistent Executive Summary sheet
✓ All files have consistent Monthly Performance sheet
✓ All files have professional formatting applied
✓ Easy to compare portfolios side-by-side
✓ Consistent look and feel across all reports
✓ KPIs automatically calculated from raw data


NEXT STEPS
==========

1. Open and review your 4 restructured portfolios
   - Executive Summary now shows KPIs and insights
   - Monthly Performance shows detailed metrics by month
   - Data Source preserves original data

2. For future portfolio files:
   - If Type B: python restructure_type_b.py "file.xlsx"
   - If Type A: python format_all.py "file.xlsx"
   - Or both for maximum consistency

3. Share this reference guide with others who work with these files
